# sublime-metapost
Files allowing Sublime Text 3 to manipulate Metapost codes

Installation :
Colocate all this files in the "~/config/sublime-text-3/packages/User" directory.

Informations :
- The snippets directory contains personal snippets using the Christophe Poulain tools (geometriesyr16.mp).
- The syntax file is really basic and would deserve a better treatment but I don't know how to do it.
- The build file uses o shell tool created by Philipp Ivaldi : dlf-metapost
